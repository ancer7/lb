# HAProxy_configuration_Ansible

I've created an Ansible playbook to Configure Reverse Proxy i.e. Haproxy and update it's configuration file automatically on each time new Managed node (Configured With Apache Webserver) join the inventory. Ansible is a great tool for Configuration Management & Automation. This Task was given by Sir Vimal Daga in the Arth training recently.

To know more about Ansible, read my blog:\

ðŸ”¹ It should automatically update the Haproxy Configuration file (configured on one of the Managed Node) each time a new Managed Node joins th inventory for webservice configuration.
